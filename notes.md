- `wrangler generate compare-words-worker`
- `wrangler publish`
    - put it on my subdomain: `compare-words-worker.chantastic.workers.dev`
- changed name via `wrangler.toml` to `compare-words`
    - re-publish
- change to `type: webpack` in `wrangler.toml`
- add `compare-words` lib
    - use lib as usual. export a static assessment
    - re-deploy
- i can test this thing locally using [miniflare](https://miniflare.dev/core/modules)
    - miniflare can be run and executed using `npx miniflare {script path}`
    - by default it doesn't support module syntax, but you can use the `-m` option
    - unfortunately, it won't be able to render npm packages
    - fortunately we can run it against our built script, post `wrangler build`
    - out of the box (for this template), it lands in `script.js`
